# "Reel" Realities: How Gender and Age Shape Success Across Box Office and Streaming Platforms
## Abstract (will refine later, way too short for now)

Over the past decade, we have seen a rise in equal gender representation worldwide. This longstanding issue is now being addressed by various industries, including one of the most influential: the film industry. Or at least, so it seems...

Are women truly being represented in an equal way to men in movies? What is the "Reel" reality behind these attempts? Is sexualization truly a thing of the past? How does this vary around the world? We will attempt to tackle these questions in our analysis to get to the bottom of the true intentions of production studios.

Who runs the world? Money. Hence, to answer the questions above, we will look at the impact of gender representation on profit. Putting into evidence whether or not a secret formula has been discovered by directors to gain success through gender representation. 

## Research questions (to refine and rewrite):
1. How can we measure success? Is success solely based on profit? On ratings? To answer these questions we will attempt to create our own metric to evaluate success.
2. What is the impact of actor's gender and age on success? How does it vary across time, gender and countries?
3. How does it compare to streaming platforms? Do movies made for these platforms follow a different formula? Have box office movies adapted since the rise of streaming?
4. What are the social reasons behind the presence of female characters in movies? Is it due to sexualization or genuine equality of representation?

## Additional datasets (waiting for complete final confirmation before writing):
1. IMDB dataset
2. Google trends
## Methods (develop once finished):
1. Regression Analysis: Define success as a binary outcome (revenue to cost ratio), predict the likelihood of a movie's success based on the categories mentioned.
2. Time Series Analysis: Analyze how trends in gender roles, lead actor age, and box office success have changed over time. Could compare to socio-economic events that would have an impact on box office thanks to Google trends.
3. Cluster Analysis (instead of regression analysis): Group movies based on characteristics (genre, gender of lead roles, and character archetypes). How these groupings correlate with success.
4. Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP): Analyze plot summaries and reviews for language indicative of sexualization (e.g., objectifying terms) or agency (e.g., leadership roles).
