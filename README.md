# Reel Realities: How Gender and Age Shape Success Across Box Office and Streaming Platforms
## Abstract (to change for now just copy pasted)
We decided to study the difference in representation of genders in movies. How does the proportion of male vs female actors influence revenue along different categories (genre, country, year, languageâ€¦)? Does the age of the actor at the time of recording have an impact? What does that tell us about the reason for the representation of female characters? Are they represented with a goal of equality or to attract audiences through sexualization? We also would like to compare these findings between Box office movies and Streaming platform destined movies. Finally, we would like to see if the acclaim (rating) of the movies is affected in the same way as revenue.
## Research questions (to refine and rewrite):
1. Male vs Female: A preliminary study on the impact on revenue in different genres and at different times. Is this the same in different countries or in different languages?
2. What about age? How does the age of the actors affect revenue according to the categories above.
3. How does it compare to streaming platforms? Are movies made for these platforms different? Have box office movies adapted since the rise of streaming?
4. What are the social reasons behind the presence of female characters in movies? Is it due to sexualization or genuine equality of representation?
5. Are these results different when looking at the acclaim (ratings) of a movie instead of revenue?
## Additional datasets (develop on each dataset):
1. IMDB dataset
2. Google trends
## Methods (develop once finished):
1. Regression Analysis: Define success as a binary outcome (revenue to cost ratio), predict the likelihood of a movie's success based on the categories mentioned.
2. Time Series Analysis: Analyze how trends in gender roles, lead actor age, and box office success have changed over time. Could compare to socio-economic events that would have an impact on box office thanks to Google trends.
3. Cluster Analysis (instead of regression analysis): Group movies based on characteristics (genre, gender of lead roles, and character archetypes). How these groupings correlate with success.
4. Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP): Analyze plot summaries and reviews for language indicative of sexualization (e.g., objectifying terms) or agency (e.g., leadership roles).
